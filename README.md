### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

~~I study Computer Science & Software Engineering at the University of Otago. I also work there as a research assistant and lab demonstrator. In my spare time I run the Otago Computer Science Society (OCSS) and write code. Maybe I should get out more?~~

I recently graduated with a BSc in Computer Science and Software Engineering from the University of Otago. I just moved to Melbourne and started looking for a job. When I'm not writing code, I'm getting out more.
